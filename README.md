# WSDL poc

## Generating WSDL

This POC uses a `wsdl-tsclient` to generate the types based on a given WSDL (available on the `resources` directory), and to generated it you just have to run:

```sh
npm run generate
```

And generated files can be found at `src/generated`.

## Performing a client call

Checkout `src/index.ts` for examples.
